# mc-plugin
Java plugin created for the game Minecraft (using Bukkit API)
=============================================================

I created this plugin in the Spring of 2015 with a friend of mine. This plugin was made for a Minecraft server we were making. The plugin's function was to create an RPG sense to the game of Minecraft. However, plans fell through and we only really were able to complete the Utils.

The plugin does indeed work, besides the limited features it has. It has a resource to fully connect to a MySQL database. We used the database to track stats. All stats were able to be logged. The code in the plugin was not the most efficient. Many things could have used touch-ups if the project was continued.
